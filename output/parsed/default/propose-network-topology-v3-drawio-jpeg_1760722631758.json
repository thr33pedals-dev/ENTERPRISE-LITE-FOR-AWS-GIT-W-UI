  "executive_summary": "This network topology proposal presents a well-structured three-tier hierarchical campus network design with modern high-speed connectivity and strategic redundancy at the distribution layer. The architecture demonstrates strong technical fundamentals but has a critical single point of failure at the core layer that requires immediate attention.",
  "detailed_summary": "The proposed network topology implements a classic three-tier hierarchical design spanning a multi-floor campus environment from basement to level 5. The architecture features a single core switch providing campus-wide connectivity through 10G and 25G fiber uplinks to redundant distribution layer switches configured with StackWise Virtual technology. Each floor is served by stacked C9300-48P access switches providing PoE+ connectivity for end devices, with dual-homed 100G fiber uplinks ensuring redundancy. While the distribution and access layers demonstrate excellent redundancy planning, the single core switch represents a critical vulnerability that could result in complete campus network failure. The design shows strong capacity planning with high-speed fiber backbone and modern switching platforms, but lacks visibility into security architecture, management systems, and WAN connectivity. Key strengths include the StackWise Virtual implementation for distribution layer high availability, comprehensive PoE+ deployment for modern device support, and scalable fiber infrastructure. Primary risks center on core layer single point of failure, potential capacity constraints under high utilization, and operational complexity of the StackWise Virtual configuration. Immediate recommendations include implementing core switch redundancy, developing comprehensive network monitoring, and creating detailed implementation documentation.",
