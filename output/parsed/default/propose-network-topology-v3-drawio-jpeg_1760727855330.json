    "executive_summary": "This is a three-tier hierarchical campus network design featuring a single core switch, dual StackWise Virtual distribution switches, and dual-homed access layer switches across 5 floors plus basement. The design provides good redundancy at the access and distribution layers but has a critical single point of failure at the core layer.",
    "detailed_summary": "The proposed network topology implements a classic three-tier hierarchical design suitable for a multi-floor campus environment. The architecture features a single core switch connecting to redundant StackWise Virtual distribution switches, which in turn provide dual-homed connectivity to access layer switch stacks on each floor (Levels 2-5 and Basement). The design uses modern high-speed fiber optics including 10G SFP+ for core-to-distribution links, 25G SFP28 for server connectivity, and 100G SFP+ for distribution-to-access connections. While the design provides excellent redundancy at the access layer through dual-homing and at the distribution layer through StackWise Virtual technology, it suffers from a critical single point of failure at the core layer. The use of Cisco C9300 series switches throughout the access layer provides consistency and modern features including PoE+ capability. Key risks include core switch failure causing campus-wide outage and potential bandwidth bottlenecks at core uplinks. Opportunities include the scalable architecture design and high availability features at lower layers.",
