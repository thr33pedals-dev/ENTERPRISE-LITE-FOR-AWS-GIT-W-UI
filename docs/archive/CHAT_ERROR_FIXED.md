# ✅ Chat Error FIXED!

---

## 🎉 **Good News: The Error is Fixed!**

The "Failed to fetch" error was caused by a **null reference** in the server code, not a missing API key.

**What was wrong:**
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN):
sources: manifest.mainFile.filename  // ❌ mainFile was null

// NEW CODE (FIXED):
sources: manifest.mainFile ? manifest.mainFile.filename : 'Uploaded files'  // ✅
```

---

## 🧪 **Test Results:**

```
✅ API Status: Working
✅ Chat Endpoint: Working  
✅ Response: AI is responding
✅ Sources: "Uploaded files"
```

**The chat is now working!** 🎉

## 🚀 **What You Can Do Now:**

### **1. Test in Browser:**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. You should see your uploaded PDF file

### **2. Try These Questions:**
