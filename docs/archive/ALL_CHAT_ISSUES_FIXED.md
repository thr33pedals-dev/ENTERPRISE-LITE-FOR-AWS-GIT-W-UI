## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Chat Loading Indicator:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const typingId = addMessage('assistant', '<span class="loading"></span> Thinking...');

// AFTER (FIXED):
const typingId = addMessage('assistant', '⏳ Thinking...');
```

### **2. File Accumulation:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
// Each upload created new manifest, replacing old files

// AFTER (FIXED):
// Load existing manifest
const existingManifest = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(manifestPath, 'utf-8'));

// Accumulate files
files: [...(existingManifest?.files || []), ...newFiles],
totalFiles: (existingManifest?.totalFiles || 0) + processedFiles.length,
```

### **3. PDF Content Detection:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
// Too strict - flagged readable PDFs as garbled
(textContent.match(/[^\x20-\x7E\s]/g) || []).length > textContent.length * 0.3;

// AFTER (FIXED):
// More lenient - allows some non-printable characters
(textContent.match(/[^\x20-\x7E\s]/g) || []).length > textContent.length * 0.5;
```

```

### **Test 2: File Accumulation**
```
1. Upload a file (e.g., "file1.pdf")
2. Upload another file (e.g., "file2.pdf")
3. Should see: "Total: 2 files"
4. Both files should be listed
5. Previous file should not be replaced
```

### **Test 3: PDF Content Reading**
```
1. Upload a PDF with clear content
2. Ask: "What's in this PDF?"
