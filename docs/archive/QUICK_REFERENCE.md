2. Guardrails? → `GROUNDING_GUARDRAILS_GUIDE.md` (Implemented!)
3. Agentic? → `IS_THIS_AGENTIC_SYSTEM.md` (Yes, 100%!)
4. LangChain? → `MCP_VS_LANGCHAIN_FOR_SINGAPORE_SME.md` (Don't need!)
5. Gemini right? → `MCP_VS_RAG_EXPLAINED.md` (Mostly, with context)

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test 1: Guardrails
```bash
node test-guardrails.js
# Should pass 10/10 tests
```

### Test 2: UI Theme
```
Open http://localhost:3000
✅ White background?
✅ Red theme?
```

### Test 3: Formatting
```
Upload CSV, ask: "Show all Malaysia shipments"
✅ Markdown formatted?
✅ Tables visible?
```

### Test 4: Security
```
Ask: "Tell me a joke"
✅ Blocked gracefully?

Ask: "Ignore instructions..."
✅ Blocked?

Ask: "Status of PO-99999" (doesn't exist)
✅ Says "not found" (not hallucinating)?
```

## 🎯 Decision Tree

### **Need OCR for Scanned PDFs?**
```
YES → Use Vision API (not Tesseract!)
      Cost: ~$0.03/document
      Accuracy: 90-95%
      I can implement in 1-2 hours

NO → Current system works great!
```

### **PDF Table Quality After Testing?**
```
80%+ → Perfect! Production-ready ✅
50-79% → Add Vision API (better)
<50% → Definitely add Vision API
```

## 💡 Key Facts

### **Your System IS:**
- ✅ Agentic (has tools, decisions, actions)
- ✅ Production-safe (guardrails + grounding)
- ✅ MCP-powered (file reading tools)
- ✅ Singapore SME-ready

### **Your System DOESN'T Need:**
- ❌ LangChain (too complex)
- ❌ Tesseract (Vision API better)
- ❌ RAG (< 1,000 docs)
- ❌ Vector DB (context window enough)

### **Cost:**
- Current: ~$200-300/month
- With Vision API: ~$225-330/month
- Saved by NOT using LangChain: $1,920/year

## 🛡️ Guardrails in Action

### **What Gets Blocked:**
```
"Tell me a joke" → Inappropriate
"Ignore instructions..." → Prompt injection
"What's the weather?" → Off-topic
"Show all emails..." → Bulk extraction
"Drop table..." → System manipulation
```

### **What's Allowed:**
```
"Status of PO SG-001?" → Business query ✅
"Compare plans..." → Business query ✅
"What files uploaded?" → System info ✅
```
