# 🔧 **USER MESSAGES FIXED!**

---

## ❌ **The Problem:**
Your questions were disappearing from the chat history because the `loadStatus()` function was being called on every page load and clearing the chat.

---

## ✅ **The Solution:**
Modified the chat clearing logic to only clear the chat when it's actually empty or just contains the welcome message.

---

## 🔧 **Technical Fix:**

### **BEFORE (BROKEN):**
```javascript
// Always cleared chat when no files uploaded
messages.innerHTML = `
    <div class="message assistant">
        👋 Hi! I'm your AI assistant...
    </div>
`;
conversationHistory = [];
```

### **AFTER (FIXED):**
```javascript
// Only clear chat if it's empty or just has welcome message
if (messages.children.length === 0 || 
    (messages.children.length === 1 && messages.children[0].textContent.includes('Hi! I\'m your AI assistant'))) {
    messages.innerHTML = `
        <div class="message assistant">
            👋 Hi! I'm your AI assistant...
        </div>
    `;
    conversationHistory = [];
}
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

### **Test 1: Normal Chat**
```
1. Ask a question: "What products do we have?"
2. See your question in chat (should stay visible)
3. Get AI response
4. Ask follow-up: "Tell me more"
5. Both questions should be visible
```

### **Test 2: Page Refresh**
```
1. Have a conversation with multiple messages
2. Refresh the page
3. Your messages should still be there
4. Chat history should persist
```

### **Test 3: File Upload/Delete**
```
1. Upload files and chat
2. Delete all files
3. Chat should clear only when appropriate
4. New conversations should work normally
```
