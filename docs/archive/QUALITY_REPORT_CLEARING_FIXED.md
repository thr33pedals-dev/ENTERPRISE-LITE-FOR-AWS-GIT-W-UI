# ✅ Quality Report Clearing FIXED!

---

## 🚨 **The Problem You Found:**

**Issue:** Quality report numbers were still showing even after refreshing with no files uploaded  
**Root Cause:** The `loadStatus()` function wasn't clearing the quality report when no files were present

---

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**

### **Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
// Only loaded data when files existed
if (result.status.dataUploaded) {
    // Load quality report and files
} 
// Missing: No clearing when no files!
```

### **After (FIXED):**
```javascript
if (result.status.dataUploaded) {
    // Load quality report and files
} else {
    // No files uploaded - clear everything
    messageInput.disabled = true;
    sendBtn.disabled = true;
    
    // Clear quality report
    qualityReport.innerHTML = 'Upload files to see quality report';
    
    // Clear uploaded files
    uploadedFiles.innerHTML = 'No files uploaded yet';
    
    // Clear chat
    messages.innerHTML = 'Welcome message...';
    conversationHistory = [];
}
```
